# Nirog
Nirog is a healthcare project designed to predict the probability of patients developing diabetes and heart attacks. The system analyzes specific health attributes to provide early warnings, enabling timely medical intervention. The project focuses on two primary domains:

1. Diabetes Prediction

Nirog utilizes patient data to predict the likelihood of developing diabetes by analyzing key attributes such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, family history, glucose levels, physical activity, and dietary habits. Older individuals and those with higher BMI values or elevated blood pressure are at greater risk. Genetic predisposition also plays a significant role, as does having high fasting glucose levels. Sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary habits further increase the risk of developing diabetes. By evaluating these factors, Nirog provides an early prediction of diabetes onset, enabling timely medical intervention and personalized health management.

2. Heart Attack Prediction

For heart attack prediction, Nirog evaluates several cardiovascular health indicators, including age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and smoking status. The risk of heart attack increases with age, and men are generally at higher risk at an earlier age compared to women. High levels of LDL cholesterol and persistent high blood pressure significantly contribute to the risk. Additionally, smoking is a major risk factor, further elevating the likelihood of a heart attack. By analyzing these attributes, Nirog provides early risk assessments to support preventative healthcare.
